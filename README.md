# My_Reads-A_book_tracking_app

This project is made for the Udacity Front-Developer Nanodegree course. The purpose of this app is to manage the books the you are currently reading, want to read or already read. I was provided with a starting pack which contained the database with the books and also the structure and the design of the app. 

# Run the app 

In order to run the app you need to have installed on your machine NodeJs. Second you have to open command prompt, navigate to the directory with the app and to run the following commands: 
  1. npm install
  2. npm start
 
The last step is to navigate to the following adress http://localhost:3000 with the browser of your choice. 

# Have fun :D
